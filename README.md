# CAINA-assembler-is-not-assembler

## Introduction

WELCOME to Lindooooooren's **CAINA-assembler-is-not-assembler**!   
You can code/execute the `"ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE"` supported by `CAIE` using this piece of ~~shit~~.


## How to use

1) The interface have a box which shows `variables` and `data` which are helpful in the `CAIE syllabus`.  
2) The lower box is an error console logging box which shows essential `error message` when error occurs.  
2) The software have 3 button with functions, which are `File Open`, `Stepping`, `Clearing`.  
4) File Open button would require to open `.txt` files which contains the `"CAIE Assembly Code"`.  
5) Stepping button would step the code one by one when code is loaded.  
6) Clearing button would simply clear everything and initialize the whole setup.


## Future plans
```
🤔: incoming
😊: already done
😢: no idea yet
```

* 🤔Plan to add a new interface which can input the code directly, while error happens highlight the error lines.  
* 😢Plan to add a more human friendly notification system which tells the possible solution when error happen if user move the cursor on error console.  
* 😊Plan to add more `CAIE assembly Opcode` support.
* 😢Plan to add more user friendly information and guides.
* 😢Improves efficiency.


## Important notes

* You can report `issue` to this repo. Due to some reasons I may not check them regularly, sorry for apologize😢~
* Do not expect for a release for macOS. ~~I suck at apple's DAMN FREAKING PRODUCTS.~~
* Linux version may be considered in future **BUT NOT NOW**, time is something which costs me too much.

## Miscellaneous

* I begain making this stuff in `2023|01|01`, for a ROOKY guy like me, its kinda hard to program a ~~shit~~ into goodies, only keep trying could SLOWLY improves😭
* Its kinda nightmare for me to mess the first trial of repo on GITHUB, I mean my first repo DIED after trying to merge something, what you see is currently the second repo.
* Please considering to give me a `⭐` if you do really like it, which depends on yourself.
