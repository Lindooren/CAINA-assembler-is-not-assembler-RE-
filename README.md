# CAINA-assembler-is-not-assembler
## Introduction

* This software is NOT a real assembler! Instead just a tracer which debug CAIE based assembly code.  
* For windows users, you can download the file from release page, unzip and pack it.
* For mac and linux users, please clone the repo and make a pack yourselves, or run the "main.py" if you already have python environment.  

## How to use

1) The interface have a box which shows variables and data which are needed in the CAIE syllabus.  
2) The lower box is an error console logging box which shows essential error message when error occurs.  
2) The software have 3 button with functions, which are File Open, Stepping, Clearing.  
4) File Open button would require to open .txt files which contains the "CAIE Assembly Code".  
5) Stepping button would step the code one by one when code is loaded.  
6) Clearing button would simply clear everything and initialize the whole setup.  


## Important notes

* You can report issue to this repo on GitHub. HOWEVER, for most of the times or periods I won't have a look at them, TOO BUSY as a simple reason~  
* Do not expect for a release for macOS. My Virtual machine's performance sucks while apple devices are EXPENSIVE :(  

## Future plans

* Plan to add a new interface which can input the code directly, while error happens highlight the error lines.  
* Plan to add a more human friendly notification system which tells the possible solution when error happen if user move the cursor on error console.
