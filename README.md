# CAINA-assembler-is-not-assembler
## Introduction

* This software is NOT an assembler! Just a tracer which shows some "virtual" information and changes.  
* For mac and linux users, please download the repo and make a pack yourselves, or run the "main.py" if you already have python environment installed.

## How to use

1) The interface have a box which shows variables and data which are needed in the CAIE syllabus.  
2) The software have 4 button with functions, which are File Open, Stepping, Clearing and Error Explain.  
3) File Open button would require to open .txt files which contains the "CAIE Assembly Code".  
4) Stepping button would step the code one by one when code is loaded.  
5) Clearing button would simply clear everything and initialize the whole setup.  
6) Error Explain button would head out where the issue is in the code.  

## Notes

* Do not report issue on this repo as the programmer is busy all the time.  
* Do not expect to obtain executables for macOS. Virtual machine sucks while real apple devices are too EXPENSIVE :(
